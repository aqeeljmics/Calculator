Basic calculator with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

In this project, I've created a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript.

Overview:
- The class is for styling and the ID is used for accessing the element in JavaScript.
- Each button has a class of either 'symbol' or 'number', which are used for styling purposes.
- Each button also has an onclick function assigned to it.
- The wipe() function is used to clear the display by resetting the value of the input tag to an empty string.
- The show() function is used to type the corresponding value of the clicked button (represented as n in js file) into the input tag.
- The calc() function evaluates the value of the input tag and does the actual calculations.
